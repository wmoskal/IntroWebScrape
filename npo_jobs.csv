Apprentice Entrepreneur

If you are passionate about entrepreneurship, always wanted to start your own company but don’t know how or haven’t had your brilliant idea yet, this is the job posting for you.  We are looking employee #1 for a startup looking to disrupt the real estate industry.  As an apprentice entrepreneur, you will be mentored and work closely with a successful entrepreneur who is a Harvard grad, started four companies, raised over $30M+ of VC funding, and expert at software development, sales, and marketing.
This position is not the typical corporate ladder type job.  It is NOT a stepping stone to graduate school or another job.  If you are not sure what you want to do with your life and want a good ""learning"" experience, then this is NOT the position for you.  We want super ambitious people preferably from humble backgrounds who want to rule the world.
Requirements:
- Recent graduate who has excelled in life (went to a top-tier school, did something unique and amazing, etc…)
- Attention to detail to the point of being annal.  What was spelled wrong here?  Did that bother you?
- Can’t stand being part of the machine... you want to build the machine.
- Hungry to succeed and willing to go all-in to make it happen!
- Genius software developer who wants to learn the business side.  However, if you are smart, we are willing to teach you how to code as well (we’ve done this successfully with others).  By the end of this experience, you will be able to Amazon, Yelp, Zillow, etc… from scratch
- Willing to work for $40k for the first year, scale to $100k+ within 12-18 months, and hopefully become a millionaire.  If the business doesn’t get to that level, there will be opportunities to work on another business idea or join the entrepreneur’s current successful company
The ideal candidate must be an entrepreneur at heart and have had dreams of running their own company since childhood.  You must have the creativity to come up with new ideas, have the technical chops to build it, the business acumen to market it and management skills to build a team to support it.  Most of all you must be a perfectionist and results oriented.
You'll be working hard for sure, but you'll also learn a tremendous amount and get to experience the joys and challenges of working in a fast-paced and highly entrepreneurial internet company.  If you consider yourself in the top %1 of entrepreneurs, then please send your resume and why you think you would be good a fit.

To apply for this position, please send a cover letter and resume to: jobs@massrealty.com

Agiloft Overview

Agiloft’s mission is to provide agile business process automation software solutions that help our clients adapt rapidly and scale efficiently; and to accomplish this through teamwork and partnership.  Our suite of products includes Contract Management, ServiceDesk/ITIL, License Management, and general Workflow Management.

We believe so strongly in our committed and talented implementation team’s ability to deliver a world class customer experience that we offer our customers a 100% satisfaction guarantee on services as well as licenses. No questions asked.

Job Overview

You will join the team responsible for designing and implementing software configurations to meet the needs of customers ranging in size from start-ups to Chevron and the US Air Force. Each client needs something different so this position requires a deep understanding of the system's capabilities and the ability to see issues from the customer's perspective. 

The breakthrough we made at Agiloft is that the software can be configured to meet all these different needs without writing a line of code. Everything is done through a wizard-based customization interface using a standard browser. 

That does not mean that this is an easy job. You will need a strong analytical and logical mind, familiarity with computers, good judgment, people skills, and excellent attention to detail in this position. We hire based on intelligence and aptitude; software development experience is not required – in fact, if you want to write code this is not the right job for you. Conversely, top performers in this position have degrees in Math, Economics and one has a PhD in Musicology, so we aren't looking only for purely technical candidates. 

Job Responsibilities
•	 Manage customer projects as part of a team 
•	 Follow use cases and specifications and implement customized systems within the Agiloft framework.
•	 Carry out customer follow-up activities such as training, documentation, and customer support.  
•	 Build and test the customizations and demonstrates the software to the customer.
•	 You may also be asked to participate in activities such as providing customer support, managing or working on internal projects
•	 Other activities suitable for your skill set and based on company needs.

 Job Requirements
•	Strong analytical skills, creativity, familiarity with web-based technologies, and the ability to rapidly learn a complex and multifaceted program
•	4 year college degree and at least two years of full time work experience, but not necessarily as an analyst.
•	Excellent written and verbal communication skills.
•	Good judgment and the capacity to independently evaluate situations and identify the optimum course of action.
•	Ability to interact politely with the occasional difficult customer.
•	Initiative in seeking ways to contribute to the success of the company that go beyond a narrow definition of job responsibilities.
•	Experience with database concepts and web based technologies are a plus, but SQL/programming expertise is not required. 

Benefits
• Competitive salary 
• Incentive bonuses 
• Referral bonuses
• Equity in a profitable and fast-growing cloud software company
• 401K plan - company matching
• Health /dental insurance
• Generous vacation
• Professional development and career growth opportunities
